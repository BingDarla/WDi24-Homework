          <h2>Ada Lovelace The Musical</h2>
          <p>It turns out a person called Ethan Lewis Maltby has been so inspired by Ada Lovelace as to write a musical.</p>

          <p>The show follows Ada as she negotiates childhood, love, ambition and her scientific studies which would later influence the world in unimaginable ways.</p>

          <p>Here is just Act I to whet your appetite:</p>


          <h3>Act I</h3>
          <p>Ada is sketching in a notebook sitting up a tree. As she ponders over her latest ideas about flying, she is interrupted by the arrival of her mother, Lady Byron. Ada's governess follows her mother, complaining loudly about Ada's behaviour. The governess has had enough of Ada's back-chatting, and Lady Byron is insistent that Ada curb her attitude. A heated argument ensues, with Ada pointing out all of the governess's mistakes and Lady Byron trying to quash Ada's irrepressible intellect. The governess quits, prompting Lady Byron to threaten Ada with severe punishment if she doesn't behave better when the next governess is employed.
          A party is in full swing at the Byron residence, and Ada is all dressed up and being introduced to her mother's distinguished guests. Ada is not pleased to be paraded about, and even less with the adults' patronising behaviour. She amuses herself by creating mischief amongst the guests, spreading misinformation.
          Having caught on to Ada's naughtiness at the party the previous evening, Lady Byron has punished Ada with manual labour, believing it will teach her to value her place in society. While fetching a bucket of water from the nearby river, Ada is set upon by a gang of teenage ruffians. Just as they push her over in the water, Tom, the blacksmith's son appears to defend her.</p>
          <p>At dinner, Ada is lectured by her mother about her place in the world. Lady Byron is determined that Ada will not follow in her father's footsteps, as she displays much of the same spirit. She impresses upon Ada the expectations of a lady in good society.</p>
          <p>Ada and Tom have been meeting in secret for some time, and Ada has begun to help him with his studies. She urges him to better himself and he is inspired by her intelligence and love of learning.
          While out in the village, Lady Byron is stopped by the blacksmith, thanking her for Ada's help with Tom's studies. Lady Byron coldly receives the compliment and rushes home to admonish Ada for socialising with the lower classes. Tom meanwhile, continues to ponder his conversations with Ada.</p>
          <p>Tom sits waiting for Ada in their usual place by the river. Unbeknownst to him, Ada has been apprehended by Lady Byron, who whisks her away to live in London.</p>
          <p>Ada is at a high society London party, now aged 17. She is, once again being led around by her mother, who has begun to look for suitable matches for her daughter. Ada is introduced to Charles Babbage, and it becomes obvious to each that they have common interests in mathematics and scientific inventions. After an animated conversation, in which Babbage is impressed by Ada's perspicacity, he invites her to his house to meet his daughter.</p>
          <p>Ada confides in her new friend Georgiana that she has been secretly writing letters to her sweetheart Tom, who never replies. Later on, Ada wanders into Babbage's study and thrilled with his work, begins to rifle through his papers. Babbage is surprised to find her there, but his admiration of her grows as she shows understanding of his work through some astute observations.</p>
          <p>Lady Byron comes upon Ada, who is daydreaming. Suspecting that she is pining after Tom, Lady Byron persuades Ada that she should give up the idea. She tells Ada that her best chance for the future is a good alliance through marriage, and that she has found a suitable match. Ada agrees to meet Lovelace.</p>
          <p>On a charming picnic, Ada discovers that Lovelace is a respectful, well-rounded man that she rather likes. She believes she will grow to love him and decides to accept him if he proposes.</p>
          <p>Ada's wedding reception is in full swing. On this occasion she is enjoying being introduced to the many guests Lady Byron has invited, but is shocked when Tom appears...
